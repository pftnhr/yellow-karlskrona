## How to customise a theme

All theme files are stored in your `system/themes` folder. All layout files are stored in your `system/layouts` folder. You can edit these files. Your changes will not be overwritten when the website is updated.

The default theme is defined in file `system/extensions/yellow-system.ini`. A different theme can be defined in the [page settings](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-core#settings-page) at the top of each page, for example `Theme: stockholm`.
